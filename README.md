# Bluejay
Bluejay is a classroom manager app for teachers. Our team decided to make this as our final project for Viking Code School because we hoped that it would provide special education teachers with a tool to reward their students for good behavior in class and making positive steps towards correcting bad classroom habits. Specifically it's targeted towards middle school kids because other existing sites that filled a similar need target early elementary school children. 

We used an agile development workflow, completing the core functionality of the site after 2 single week sprints.
